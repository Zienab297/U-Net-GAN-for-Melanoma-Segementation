# U-Net GAN for Melanoma Segmentation

## Project Overview

This project focuses on image segmentation, a fundamental task in computer vision where the goal is to partition an image into distinct regions or objects. The project uses TensorFlow to implement and train a model for image segmentation, with applications likely related to medical imaging based on the dataset used.

## Features

### 1. **Data Preparation**
   - Loads and preprocesses image data from the directory `/kaggle/input/cancer1/data`.
   - Applies transformations to prepare input and target images for model training.

### 2. **Model Architecture**
   - Implements a neural network architecture suitable for segmentation tasks.
   - Utilizes TensorFlow and Keras APIs for building and training the model.

### 3. **U-Net GAN Integration**
   - The project leverages a U-Net architecture as the generator in a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN).
   - U-Net is used to create high-resolution segmentations, with skip connections for better feature propagation.
   - The GAN framework includes a discriminator that evaluates the quality of the generated segmentations, leading to improved performance through adversarial training.

### 4. **Training Process**
   - Configures training parameters such as batch size, buffer size, and image dimensions.
   - Includes methods for training and visualizing model performance.

### 5. **Evaluation and Visualization**
   - Evaluates the model on test images to measure segmentation accuracy.
   - Provides visualizations of input images, ground truth, and predicted segmentations.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow matplotlib
   ```

3. Place the dataset in the directory specified by the `PATH` variable in the notebook.

4. Open the notebook using Jupyter Notebook or a compatible editor:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Segmentation.ipynb
   ```

5. Execute the cells sequentially to:
   - Load and preprocess the data.
   - Train the segmentation model.
   - Evaluate and visualize the results.

## Example Code Snippets

### Data Loading
```python
import tensorflow as tf

def load(image_file):
    image = tf.io.read_file(image_file)
    image = tf.image.decode_jpeg(image)

    w = tf.shape(image)[1]
    w = w // 2

    real_image = image[:, :w, :]
    input_image = image[:, w:, :]

    return input_image, real_image
```

### Model Training
```python
BUFFER_SIZE = 400
BATCH_SIZE = 1
IMG_WIDTH = 256
IMG_HEIGHT = 256

# Training loop here
```

## Applications

This segmentation model can be applied to various domains, including:
   - Medical imaging (e.g., tumor detection).
   - Object detection and scene understanding.
   - Autonomous systems and robotics.
